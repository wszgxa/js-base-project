In the last year, we've been updating pull requests with features that help teams give feedback and make sure only the highest quality code makes it into their projects. You can leave, manage, request, and dismiss reviews, as well as protect branches and limit merging rights. With restricted review dismissals, you can also ensure important feedback gets addressed.
